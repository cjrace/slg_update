# EES Analytics (as at 12th December)

---

172 releases from 61 statistical publications

--

Publication type breakdown:

???

Won't add up as some publications have releases of multiple types and are represented more than once

--

- 26 national statistics

--

- 31 official statistics

--

- 0 experimental statistics

???

Though we do have some in sections within current official statistics

--

- 10 ad hoc statistics

--

- 1 management information

???

We're not the default for MI, but can publish where it makes sense to join up, like having the CO2 monitors with the other COVID stats

---

Passed 500k 'unique' users

???

Big milestone

Caveat that this is based on GA, and if I've used my phone, my personal laptop and work laptop I could count as 3

--

Closing in on 1 million sessions (955k currently)

--

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/sessions_over_time.png")`

???

Floating at around 3,500/4,000 sessions per weekday, dropping to around 1, 1 and a half thousand sessions a day at weekends

Use of the platform is steadily increasing

---

More information on user journeys, comparing across publications

Analytics app - https://rsconnect/rsc/ees-analytics/

???

Hoping to look at this further in the next couple of months

Though please do talk to us if you'd want to know more or have any data related to your publication

We're always keen to have feedback on what is useful / interesting for analysts

Performance 

--

- explore data button

--

- admin datablock building

--

- admin editing release page (lots of datablocks)

--

- public table tool for files with thousands of options within filters (ongoing)

???

Still a priority issue we're working on solutions for

The timeout error pointing to full file does help this at least fail with a warning, which it wasn't doing before

# Hierarchy developments since last time

---

--

Delayed by performance issues

--

<br>

Mainly invisible work behind the scenes setting us up for the bits users will see

---

LA to Region selections now in (though not yet in tables that are created)

`r knitr::include_graphics("images/hierarchy.jpg")`

---

Search across all LAs

# User research

---

--

Admin dashboard, publication owners

--

- 5 sessions with teams from different units

--

- Publication owners managing analyst permissions and inviting new analysts

--

- Broadly positive feedback on the designs

--

- Had to tweak design due to unforeseen performance issues

???

Hoping to release in the coming weeks

--

Public, navigating through releases

--

- 9 data analysts

???

LAs and schools

--

- Search is too basic, navigating without prior knowledge is difficult

--

- Refinements to make to the release pages

--

- Improve linking back to release pages from table tool and other pages

---

layout: true

# Ongoing work

---

--

Ability to comment on specific characters of text

--

Locking content sections while in use by another analyst

--

Publication owners managing contributor access

Carry through Region to LA hierarchy into tables that are made in the table tool

--

Locations rework in databases to handle multiple names for codes and facilitate additional hierarchies

--

MoJ testing of EES

---

layout: true

# Future work
