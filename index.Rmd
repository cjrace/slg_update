Target of good and great practice by 2022 publication cycles

51 publications in scope

For tracking we're focussing on regular statistics that go out, ad hocs are not included

Though we should be championing RAP in everything

--

<br>
No more publications have reached good or great practice since last time

--

<br>
58.07 % of all steps to good and great completed, marginally up from 56.56 % in December

--

<br>
Teams need to be actively using the self-assessment tool

???

Gives analysts a clear guide for implementing RAP in achievable steps

Gives senior leaders sight and a high level understanding of progress

Allows HoP and CSSU to target support where needed
